# ToDoListWeb
A Web-Based To-Do List that allows you to create your own account.

Once logged in, you can create tasks, delete tasks, edit them, and view detailed information about them.

A task includes a title, description, deadline by date, deadline by time and progress status (only the title is necessary when creating).

You can sort tasks by name, deadline and status by clicking on the corresponding headings in the table (ascending and descending).

Also, if a task has a deadline, it will be highlighted red color if you have not marked it completed by the specified deadline.

It is also possible to cancel the last action with tasks and export the to-do list as a .csv file.

It is possible to change the user password and delete the account, if necessary.
